How LLM (Large Language Models) Helped
Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerated the development process. Here’s how:

Prompt Engineering for Code Generation
To enhance the app’s functionality and streamline development, specific prompts were used with LLMs. Examples include:

Prompt for Generating Code Snippets:

plaintext
Copy code
"Generate a Python function to create a joke card in FastHTML with dynamic content."
This prompt helped generate the code for the joke_card function, streamlining the development of the joke display component.

Prompt for Debugging and Optimization:

plaintext
Copy code
"How can I optimize the joke generation function in FastHTML for better performance?"
This prompt provided insights into optimizing asynchronous tasks and improving overall performance.

Prompt for Styling Recommendations:

plaintext
Copy code
"Suggest some modern CSS styling techniques for a floating effect on containers."
This helped in refining the UI with a floating effect, enhancing the visual appeal.

By using these targeted prompts, the LLMs provided valuable assistance in generating code, optimizing performance, and enhancing the application’s design.
